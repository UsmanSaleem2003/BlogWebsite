# BlogWebsite

This is a complete blog website named Daily Journal made by Me.
Technologies I have used while making it are Html, CSS for frontend, for templating I used EJS, for backend I used NodeJs and
it's famework ExpressJS, for database i used NoSQL database that is MongoDB and it's framwork Mongoose.


To run this on your system, you have to follow following instructions.
1)_ Install Nodejs in your system from Nodejs official Website.
2)_ Open git bash in project directory and write "npm install"....Without quotation mark...First quotation marks are just to highlight the instructions.
3)_ After that you have to write "cd ~".
4)_ TO run this app, you also have to install MongoDB from their official website and then you have to set environment variable Path.
5)_ Then you have to set variables mongod and mongosh using vite terminal...You can watch youtube video for setting of mongodb.
6)_ After that you have to open another git bash terminal and then write mongod.
7)_After that you have to go to the project directory using first git bash terminal and then write "nodemon app.js"

It will turn on your server at port 3000 and will connect the mongodb database as well. After that
8)_ Open your browser and then write "localhost:3000".
9)_ Write your blog by going to compose page. 


Thanks.
